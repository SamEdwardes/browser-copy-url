# Browser Copy URL

A lightweight JavaScript utility that enhances web browsing by adding convenient URL copying functionality to any web page with simple keyboard shortcuts.

> [!WARNING]
> This project was mostly vibe coded with Claude Code. Use at your own risk.

## Features

### üîó Quick URL Copy

- **Shortcut**: `Cmd+Shift+C` (macOS) / `Ctrl+Shift+C` (Windows/Linux)
- **Function**: Copies the current page URL to clipboard in plain text format
- **Use Case**: Perfect for quick sharing or bookmarking

### üìù Markdown URL Copy

- **Shortcut**: `Ctrl+Shift+C`
- **Function**: Copies the current page URL in markdown link format: `[Page Title](URL)`
- **Use Case**: Ideal for documentation, notes, or markdown-based content creation

### üîî Visual Feedback

- Non-intrusive notification showing the copied content
- Automatically fades out after 3 seconds
- Shows both the copy format and the actual copied text

### üõ†Ô∏è Special URL Handling

- **Atlassian URLs**: Automatically removes square brackets from page titles when creating markdown links
- **Salesforce URLs**: Strips query parameters from force.com URLs for cleaner sharing

## Installation Options

### Browser Extension

1. Save `browser-copy-url.js` as your extension's content script
2. Load as an unpacked extension or package for distribution
3. The functionality will be automatically available on all web pages

### Userscript

1. Install a userscript manager like [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) or [Greasemonkey](https://www.greasespot.net/)
2. Add `browser-copy-url.user.js` to your userscript manager
3. The script will run automatically on all websites

### Bookmarklet

1. Create a new bookmark in your browser
2. Set the URL to the contents of `browser-copy-url.bookmarklet.js`
3. Click the bookmark on any page to activate the URL copy functionality (without keyboard shortcuts)

## Security Considerations

- Uses modern Clipboard API for secure clipboard access
- No external dependencies or network requests
- Minimal permission requirements
- Client-side only - no data transmission

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Customizable keyboard shortcuts
- [ ] Additional format options (HTML, rich text)
- [ ] Support for copying selected text with URL context
- [ ] Settings panel for user preferences

## Development

### Code Style

This project uses Prettier for consistent code formatting. Formatting is automatically applied as a pre-commit hook using Husky and lint-staged.

```bash
# Format all files manually
bun run format
# or with just
just format
```

### Modifying Code

To modify the code:

1. Edit the desired JavaScript file (`browser-copy-url.js`, `browser-copy-url.user.js`, or `browser-copy-url.bookmarklet.js`)
2. If editing the bookmarklet, ensure the code remains compact and self-contained
3. Test in various browsers to ensure compatibility
4. Commit your changes - formatting will be applied automatically

## Testing

This project uses Playwright for automated testing. The tests verify functionality such as keyboard shortcuts, clipboard operations, URL formatting, and notification displays.

### Prerequisites

- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) - Fast JavaScript runtime and package manager

### Setting Up

```bash
# Install dependencies
bun install

# Install Playwright browsers (only needed once)
bun playwright install chromium
```

### Running Tests

This project includes a justfile for easy task execution. If you have [just](https://github.com/casey/just) installed, you can use the following commands:

```bash
# List all available commands
just

# Install dependencies and set up Playwright
just setup

# Run tests in headless mode
just test

# Run tests with UI mode
just test-ui

# Run tests in debug mode
just test-debug

# Start the test server
just serve

# View test report after running tests
just test-report

# Format code (requires prettier)
just format

# Run a complete test cycle
just test-all

# Create distribution files
just build

# Package for distribution
just package
```

Alternatively, you can use Bun directly:

```bash
# Run all tests headlessly
bun test

# Run tests with UI mode
bun test:ui

# Run tests in debug mode
bun test:debug

# Start the test server manually
bun run serve
```

### Test Structure

- `tests/example.html` - Test page for manual and automated testing
- `tests/copy-url.spec.ts` - Test specifications for the URL copying functionality
- `playwright.config.ts` - Playwright configuration

The tests verify:

- Clipboard operations work correctly
- Notification displays properly and contains the expected text
- Special URL handling for Atlassian domains works as expected
- UI elements appear and disappear as intended
